\# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator



\## What was your approach to designing the schedule?

Explain how you chose your activities and what made them personal or interesting.

I chose my simulation activities based on how my real life schedule may look like. 



\## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?

Describe anything surprising that happened when you tested the timing.

When testing the timing, I didn't anticipate how the timing of my first activity would be delayed after "My Simulated Day" appeared.



\## What does this assignment teach you about async code?

Compare this to a regular script that runs top to bottom without delays.

In the async code, setTimeout schedules an event to occur and doesn't pause to finish running the script. The entire script will run without waiting and the events will appear at their specified time. A regular script would immediately show all of the activities.



\## What creative element did you add?

Did you add randomization, surprise content, a twist, or other enhancements?

I customized my activities by adding emojis that closely matched the theme of each activity. 



\## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?

Explain how well your simulation represents how time works in real life.

The simulation resembles how time works in real life because scheduled activities occur over time. The simulation differs from how time works in real life because real-world schedules have overlapping activities and unpredictable delays.
